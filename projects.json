      "overview": "To follow-up on my Master's thesis at Caltech in the Center of Autonomous Systems & Technologies (CAST), I designed a new generation of multimodal M4 drones. These robots are made of up to 12 DOFs, allowing them to adopt optimal configurations to pass obstacles in complex environments. As research prototypes, these robots are often hard to maintain and poor knowledge transfer usually prevents future research to be easily integrated and tested. My task was therefore to focus on modularity and integration robotusness of both onboard hardware and software stacks, turning the new platform into a modular testing bed for all future research.",

I took an R&D project role as UAV Avionics Engineer for the newly lanched drone subproject and was in charge of the design, manufacturing, testing and integration of the avionics board of the drone. My task also included programming the flight controller, the sensor data acquisition, the telemetry and the safety protocols on the board.

EPFL Xplore was founded with that very intent, to build an initiative allowing students to learn and combine sciences, engineering, and management in a multidisciplinary environment. As students passionate by space and robotics, we dediced to found the first robotics project at EPFL. One year later, the team secured an early podium finish among 58 teams at the European Rover Challenge (ERC) 2021 and received excellence awards for both Science and Probing missions.",
